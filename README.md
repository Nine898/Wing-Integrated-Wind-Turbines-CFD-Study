# To What Extent will Wing-Integrated Wind Turbines Affect Electric Aviation Flight Ranges

# Overview
This repository contains the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) research and simulation assets for studying Wing-Wntegrated Wind Wurbines on electric aircraft. The study evaluates how integrating small wind turbines into aircraft wings affects net power generation and aerodynamic performance, and whether those effects could influence aircraft range. For this study, Wing-Integrated Wind Turbines signifies the Parallel-To-Wind Turbine from before, as it proved to be the most effective power output.

# Objectives
- Quantify turbine power output across representative flight conditions and wing locations.
- Measure changes in airplane dynamics and drag caused by turbine integration.
- Identify turbine geometries and placements that maximize net benefits for electric aircraft.
