#To What Extent will Wing-Integrated Wind Turbines Affect Electric Aviation Flight Ranges.
This repository contains all the research that is being done by me on Wing-Integrated Wind Turbines using CFD software.
this study aims to prove Wing-Integrated Wind Turbines as beneficial to electric aviation using CFD software to analyze its power output. Additionally it will look at the effect it has on drag and other airplane mechanics, such as lift and weight.
